W3SCHOOL BLOCK
==============

I don't want results from w3schools.com in my Google search results. Google used to provide a Chrome extension to allow users to prevent sites of their choice to show up in search results, but that plugin stopped working in the spring of 2015.

I couldn't find any good replacement, all Chrome extensions that I could find failed at the task, presumably because of a UI change that Google made. So i made a new one.

This extension will remove all results from w3scools.com, and it will highlight results from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org) an [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).

## Installation
If this extension ever gets mature enough it will be published to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions). Until then, follow the steps below to install it.

1. Clone this repo to your computer. Put it somewhere where you can save it, not just in your Downloads folder.
2. Open up [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) in Chrome.
3. Drag the extension folder and release it on top of the extensions list in Chrome.
